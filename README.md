## Installation

We rely on node.js for a lot of our tooling. So if you haven't got it installed(shame on you!!) go to http://nodejs.org/ and fetch it.

To install tooling dependencies, run:

    npm install

Then install the composer dependencies:

    composer install

## Workflow

It's not allowed to push directly to master branch.
All feature implementing and bugs fixing should be done using pull request.

### Test

For working with the extension, the following can be run to accomplish common tasks.

To run the PHP codesniffer run the following command:

    npm run php:codesniffer

To run the PHP Unit tests run the following command:

    npm run php:unittests

To run the PHP Functional tests run the following command:

    npm run php:functionaltests

To simulate the build process without functional tests locally, then run this packaged command:

    npm run build:suite_no_functional --silent

To simulate the full build process locally, then run this packaged command:

    npm run build:suite --silent

To watch and compile the main .less file to .css:

    npm run watch:css

When using t3kit and themes with the less compiler, three variables needs to be set (otherwise, the .less file will not be compiled):
  @main-color
  @main-text-color
  @border-color

### Products preview

Example of Page TS that allow to enable preview function of product.

```typo3_typoscript
TCEMAIN.preview {
    tx_pxaproductmanager_domain_model_product {
        useCacheHash = 1
        previewPageId = 1
        useDefaultLanguageRecord = 0
        fieldToParameterMap {
            uid = tx_pxaproductmanager_pi1[product_preview]
        }
        additionalGetParameters {
            tx_pxaproductmanager_pi1.controller = Product
            tx_pxaproductmanager_pi1.action = show
        }
    }
}
```
