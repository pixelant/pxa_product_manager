=======================
Product Attribute sets
=======================

To add attributes to the products, you must create an 'Attribute set' in which you specify the attributes.
This can then be selected in product types and automatically add attributes to products connected to that product type.

Add new attribute set
=======================

To create a new attribute set, go to List view and select the product manager (or equivalent) folder in the page tree.
Either click "Create new record" in top of page or "New record" in the Attribute set section.
